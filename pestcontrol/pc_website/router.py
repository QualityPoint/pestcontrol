"""Language-prefixed public URLs: /ar/about, /en/about.

Frappe serves every language from one URL, choosing by cookie. A crawler
carries no cookie, so exactly one language is ever indexed -- on this site
that is english, leaving the entire arabic catalogue invisible in the primary
market. Frappe has no multi-language URL support of its own, so this is ours.

Registered as `website_path_resolver`, which REPLACES frappe's own
resolve_path() call inside PathResolver.resolve(). Two consequences:

  * frappe's werkzeug RequestRedirect handling goes with it, so _delegate()
    re-raises it as frappe.Redirect.
  * There is no `endpoint == "app"` shortcut in frappe 16 -- only `desk` is
    short-circuited before the hooks. /app reaches this function, so a bug
    here takes down the desk as well as the website. The reserved check is
    deliberately the first branch, and this hook can be disabled by deleting
    one line from hooks.py plus `bench clear-cache`.
